# Consumables!

Hello Turtles! 🤗

Have you ever thought to yourself what consumables do I need? What consumables do I have? What consumables have I currently got active? And how long do those consumables have before I need to reapply them? Introducing a comprehensive, dynamic solution to all of those questions...
|🫒 "Consumables!" 🧪| 
The one-stop addon/shop for being strong - because if you want the raid to bloom, don't assume, consume! 🙇‍♂️ (100% CONSUME COMPLIANCE with ZERO EFFORT!)
